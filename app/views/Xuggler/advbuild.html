<h1>Advanced Building Topics</h1>
<h2>Building (the hard way)</h2>
<p>We try to make the build (relatively) easy, but sometimes, on
some systems, things might break. To help you debug what's going on,
here's how the <code>ant</code> build system works.</p>
<p>First, every <code>ant</code> target (e.g. <code>compile</code>,
<code>install</code>, <code>run-tests</code>, etc.) is actually composed
of two targets: a <code>-java</code> target and a <code>-native</code>
target. For example, to compile just the java source code, run <code>ant
compile-java</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ant</code> build-suite will first attempt to build all
the native code required for Xuggler, and then build all the Java code.
It creates a sub-directories under the <code>build/</code> directory for
all build-generated artifacts. Of particular importance, it creates a
directory under <code>build/native</code> for all C/C++ generated files,
and runs <code>configure</code> to try to keep your main directory as
clean as possible.</p>
<p>It does this by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>creating a directory under <code>build/native</code> based on
  the OS-name (as given by <code>config.guess</code>)</li>
  <li><code>cd</code>-ing to that directory, and running <code>sh
  ../../../configure</code>. If you're curious, you can run <code>configure
  --help</code> to see a list of the advanced configuration options that
  Xuggler supports.</li>
  <li>running <code>make all check</code> to build all the native
  code, and run all native tests.</li>
  <li><code>cd</code>-ing back to the top directory, and running <code>ant
  compile-java run-tests-java</code>.
</ol>
<p>If all this succeeds , the <code>ant install</code> does
something similar, only this time it runs <code>make install</code> to
have the native build system install all shared libraries in the right
system. On some operating systems this requires a re-linking of the
shared libraries. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>You can feel free to do any of the sub-steps yourself, and
hopefully that'll help you get this working.</p>
<h2>Building on Microsoft Windows</h2>
<p>Building on Windows is much harder than any other OS because you
can't use the Microsoft Visual C Compiler suite (<a
  href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> will not build with it).</p>
<p>This means you need to install the GNU C++/C suite on Windows. If
you haven't already done this, and built the very latest <a
  href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a>, you may want to check out
this link for instructions on how to do that: <a
  href="http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/">FFmpeg on Windows Help</a>.</p>
<p>In general, if you can already build <a
  href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> on Windows, you'll be
able to build the Xuggler.</p>
<p>Also, the <code>ant / autotools</code> build system doesn't do
well with <code>$XUGGLE_HOME</code> set to a directory name that
contains spaces or isn't on your C: drive. A good setting to use is <code>c:\msys\local</code>.
</p>

<h2>Optional Build Software</h2>
<p>Xuggler has some extra features that aren't enabled by default,
but are enabled if you have additional software installed. Here's a
brief description of what those are:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a></h3>
<p>Swig version 1.3.36 or higher.</p>
<p>By default if SWIG is not installed on your system, the Xuggler
build system uses some "already generated" java and C++ bindings. But
you can regenerate from scratch if you want, provided the following
software is installed.</p>
<p>Note: our distributions are built with a special version of SWIG
that converts Javadoc comments in C++ into Javadoc comments in Java. If
you're poking in this area let us know, and we'll point you in the
direction of how to do this, but it's not that easy.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a></h3>
<p>Valgrind version 3.3.1 or higher.</p>
<p>Xuggler comes with the ability to run a set of robust memory
self-checks on Linux systems using the Valgrind tool. If you install
that, then:</p>
<pre>
make memcheck
</pre>
<p>or</p>

<pre>
ant run-memcheck
</pre>
will run this test.
<p>Be warned, it takes a really long time to run, and will (falsely)
report lots of errors if you abort it early.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a></h3>
<p>Doxygen 1.5.8 or higher.</p>
<p>Xuggler comes with self-documenting code. If you want the C++
version, you'll need Doxygen installed.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a></h3>
<p>Version 2.20.3 or higher.</p>
<p><code>Doxygen</code> can generate really helpful object-graph
methods to analyze code, and will use <code>graphviz</code>'s <code>dot</code>
tool to do this.</p>

<h3>GNU Autotools</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf 2.63
or higher</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake
1.10.2 or higher</a>, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool
2.2.6a or higher</a>.</p>
<p>Xuggle's native code is built using a <code>gnu autotools</code>
build system. If you want to modify the library (e.g. add or remove
files from the build), you'll need these tools installed.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/">YASM</a></h3>
<p>yasm version 0.7.2 or later</p>
<p>If you have yasm installed when you configure Xuggler, we'll
include lots of assembly optimizations in <code>libx264</code> and <code>FFmpeg</code>
that can result in big speed-ups, especially when encoding. By default
our Windows installer is built with yasm, but other OS's builds must
install yasm themselves.</p>
<h2>A word on Captives and using your own version of FFmpeg</h2>
<p>In order to (believe it or not) simplify the builds for most
people, Xuggler bundles in it's own versions of:</p>

    <td><a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/"> <img
      src="http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-logo.png" alt="FFmpeg" height="25" /></a>
    </td>
    <td>
    <p>The best and fastest (and free) raw tool for decoding and
    encoding media files. It's what does the heavy lifting underneath
    Xuggler; Xuggler adds a simpler API, additional automatic testing,
    the ability to embed in other languages with simple memory
    semantics, and time-stamp adjusting to the core libav* libraries in
    FFmpeg.</p>

    <td>
    <p>VideoLAN's libx264 encoder: a free library for encoding
    H264/AVC video streams. libx264 is the leading open source
    implementation of H264/AVC encoding. Then you'll be able to use the
    ICodec.ID.CODEC_ID_H264 encoder.</p>

    <p>An MP3 encoder that works with <a
      href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>. This means by default,
    Xuggler ships with the ability to encode MP3 audio (<a
      href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> does not come with an MP3
    encoder by default).</p>

    library that encodes audio into AAC, the same format iPods and
    iPhones use.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This is helpful for most people, as it means they don't have to
build these tools and install them prior to building and installing the
Xuggler.</p>
<p>But sometimes you want to use a version of FFmpeg you've built
yourself (for special codecs). We do support this, but you'll need to
build the hard way. When running <code>configure</code> yourself, pass <code>--disable-captives</code>.
Then our build script will not use our internal captive libraries, and
instead look for the required libraries (really just FFmpeg) on your
system.</p>
<p>The recommended way to build your own version of Xuggler's native
libraries without captive libraries (or with any custom configuration
options) is as follows</p>
<pre>
ant clobber
mkdir mybuild
cd mybuild
../configure --disable-captives
make
make check
sudo make install
cd ..
ant stage-java run-tests-java
sudo ant install-java</pre>
<p>Once you've installed and build the native ffmpeg of your choice,
and built your version of the Xuggler native libraries, you can still
use our <code>ant</code> build system to build the java files. You
should however only use the <code>-java</code> targets.</p>

  source for any additional libraries Xugger also builds (e.g. <a
    href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>), along with scripts to
  integrate them into our build system (the process of integrating a
  "captive" library is called "incarcerating").</li>

  build Xuggler.</li>
  <li><code>doc/</code>: The location of generated documentation.
  <ul>

) is as follows:
<ul>
  <li><code>bin/</code>: Any executable programs (and <code>.dll</code>
  files under Windows).</li>
