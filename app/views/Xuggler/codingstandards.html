<p>And yes Virginia, that means to do a release, you need to build
your final candidate on each of those OSes. You can substitute Vista for
XP for now (but not the other way around), but expect that to change
once someone ponies up an XP build box.</p>
<p>You should try to write code that SHOULD work on all OSes and
architectures that Java is supported on (e.g. Sparc, ARM, etc), but
we're ownly on the hook for the above list right now.</p>
<p>We don't try to support Kaffe, IBM's JVM, or any other JVM, but
again, we try not to write code that stops that.</p>
<h1>Version Number Format</h1>
<p>Xuggle version numbers are of the form:</p>
<pre>       {library}.{major}.{minor}[.revision][.description]</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th scope="col">Release</th>
		<th scope="col">Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><pre>
xuggle-xuggler.1.15.137.rc1</pre></td>
		<td><p>A release candidate of xuggle-xuggler; major version is 1;
		minor version is 15; svn revision number is 137 and it's release
		candidate 1.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><pre>
xuggle-utils.2.15.35.rc1</pre></td>
		<td><p>A release candidate of xuggle-utils; major version is 2;
		minor version is 15; svn revision number is 35 and it's release
		candidate 2.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><pre>
xuggle-xuggler-red5.1.1.1129</pre></td>
		<td><p>A final release of xuggle-xuggler-red5; major version is 1;
		minor version is 1; svn revision number is 1129 and it's final.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><pre>
xuggle-xuggle-red5.1.1.1140</pre></td>
		<td><p>A final and bug fix release of xuggle-xuggler-red5; major
		version is 1; minor version is 1; svn revision number is 1140 and it's
		final. Not that since the major and minor is the same as the prior
		example, and both are &quot;final&quot; that this is a bug-fix update.</p></td>
	</tr>
        <tr>
                <td><pre>
xuggler.3.0</pre></td>
                <td><p>A major release of xuggle-xuggler; major version is 3;
                minor version is 0; There is no revision number or
                description</p></td>
        </tr>

<h1>When To Change Version Numbers</h1>
<p>Try not to do major version increments that don't add major new
features since users of the library will have to <strong>actively
</strong>choose to upgrade to use it; most people using ivy will take minor
version increments without much hesitation. None the less, here are some
guidelines for what counts as a major revision. This list is not final,
and the actual decision should be made by the release team (currently
Art and Robert).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Major Version Increments</h2>
<p>Things that should almost definitely cause a major version
increment</p>
<ul>
	<li>Changing a C++ public header file to reorder, remove or change
	a class signature or method signature; may also be necessary even if
	you add a new member (depending on the class). if you're not sure the
	header change should do a major increment change, increment major anyway.</li>
	<li>Major new feature added that breaks backwards compatibility
	(although you should try to ever break backwards compatibility).</li>
	<li>Adding a new feature that is 100% backwards compatible, but
	required adding native code.</li>
	<li>Removing a Java class or Interface, or a method from a Java
	class or Interface.</li>
	<li>Basically, if you f*ck with native code, be prepared to bump a
	major version number. Trust me on this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Minor Version Increments</h2>
<p>Things that should almost definitely cause a minor version
increment</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adding a new Java class, interface, or method</li>
	<li>Adding a new feature that is 100% backwards compatibile, but
	did not require changing native code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Revision Increments</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixing a bug in a C++ file or Java file, but no changes to
	class, interface or method signatures</li>
	<li>Documentation updates</li>
</ul>
<h1>Release Checklist</h1>
<p>This is a checklist of the steps one should take when bundling a
new release of a xuggle library.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify proposed good build from the continuous build server.</li>
  <li>Announce tree is frozen</li>
	<li>Document proposed SVN revision (from current),
	and SVN revision of any
	Externals in release notes.</li>
	<li>Make sure revision numbers in configure.ac, build.xml, and any
	windows installers are correct</li>
        <li>Uninstall old versions of library on all supported OS</li>
        <li>Install candidate on each supported OS</li>
        <li>Do the appropriate library post-install test (e.g. for
        xuggler, java -jar xuggle-xuggler.jar test/fixtures/testfile.flv
        --acodec libmp3lame /tmp/out.flv)</li>
        <li>Make sure that demos still work.</li>
        <li>Upload new jars for release to repository</li>
        <li>Upload installers and source bundle to Amazon S3</li>
        <li>Make sure uploaded files have read permission</li>
	<li>Increment major and/or minor revision numbers in tip of tree
	(must change both configure.ac and build.xml).</li>
	<li>Re-run autotools if configure.ac was changed</li>
	<li>Update any downloads web pages with new release</li>
	<li>Update blog.xuggle.com</li>
	<li>Send message to xuggler-users@groups.google.com</li>
</ul>

<h1>Source Code Conventions</h1>
<p>Here's the source code conventions we try to use. Please keep
using them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 space indention; no tabs</li>
	<li>Method and variable names should have descriptive names and
	can be any length &lt; 255 characters.</li>
	<li>Member variables of classes should begin with &quot;m&quot;:
	e.g. int myMemberVariable;</li>
	<li>Class names start with a Capital letter: e.g. class MyClass</li>
	<li>Method names start with a lower case letter: e.g. void
	myMethod()</li>
	<li>Braces should get their own line, except for variable
	initializers.</li>


	<li>You should use Packages (in Java) or Namepsaces (in C++) for
	any objects you create. Packages should be under
	&quot;com.xuggle&quot;; Namespaces should be under
	&quot;com::xuggle&quot;.</li>
	<li>Static methods SHOULD think carefully about creating any
	long-term caches and objects; they won't be cleaned up by garbage
	collectors.</li>
	<li>All objects exposed from C++ to other languages MUST derive
	from com.xuggle.ferry.RefCounted and use reference counted memory
	semantics.</li>
	<li>All methods and classes must have Javadoc style documentation.
	</li>
	<li>Unix file-format (i.e. \n line endings, not \r\n).</li>
	<li>Reformatting checkins (to remove bad formatted) are allowed,
	but ONLY if no other changes are in that check-in</li>
	<li>You break the build you fix it. No exceptions (or we back the
	change out).</li>
	<li>No check-ins without having someone else review your code; No
	exceptions.</li>
	<li>Two drink minimum for any build system changes</li>
</ul>
