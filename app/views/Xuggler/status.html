<h2>Xuggler Status</h2>
<p>
Here's where you'll find the latest information on Xuggler development,
transparency to our latest testing efforts, and instructions on how to
donate code to the project if you want.</p>
<h3><a href="http://build.xuggle.com/view/Stable/">Latest Builds</a></h3>
<p>
Xuggle maintains a continuous-build server for our projects. You can
check it out here for the latest and greatest builds of our software.

Sometimes people get impatient waiting for an official release, and want to
use the very latest (and sometimes experimental) version of Xuggler.  If you're
one of those people, but also don't want to build Xuggler yourself, our continuous
build server makes installers out of any build that passes all Xuggler tests.

<h3>Latest Test Results</h3>
<p>
Xuggler development is under a &quot;test first, ask questions
later&quot; philosophy.</p>
<p>
That means each new feature should come with self-contained tests; each
bug fix should have a regression test; and all tests should be run
frequently to keep us honest.
</p>
<p>
We run those tests on every checkin as part of our continuous build
framework. See here for the very latest results.

<p>On Linux systems, we run a robust memory leak and corruption test
on every checkin. You can see the latest results below.</p>

<h3>Donating Code to the Xuggler Project</h3>
<p>If you'd like to donate code to the Xuggler project we're all for it.
There are however certain restrictions and conventions you need to
follow in order for us to accept your code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <b>must</b> execute the
  #{a @Xuggler.contributor()}
  Xuggle Contributor Agreement
  #{/a}
   and send us
  a scanned copy with signature (see the agreement for where to send
  it to).  This agreement is similar to the agreement GNU
  uses for user-contributed code and ensures we can continue to offer
  Xuggler as open-source, even if your management later decides they want
  to retract your code.</li>
  <li>You <b>must</b> submit test-cases (either JUnit or CPPTest)
  test cases for your bug fix or new feature</li>
  <li>You <b>must</b> follow the 
  #{a @Xuggler.codingstandards() }
  source code conventions
  #{/a}
   in the Xuggler files.</li>
  <li>You <b>must</b> run the "ant run-memcheck" test suite if you
  add CPP code, and add appropriate tests for leaks.</li>
  <li>You <i>should</i> provide documentation of your change
  (really increases your chances of acceptance).</li>
  <li>You <i>should</i> shower on a regular basis; really; people
  prefer that.</li>
</ul>
To submit your patches, please use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/xuggler-users">xuggler-users</a>
forum.
